  The log-as function name is the epitome of method-specific.

  It can be replaced by a shared script if the shared script contains a conditional for
  every method. However, some methods change the value based on request content, so a
  different method might have a much more complex implementation.

  It could be replaced in many cases by method-specific external variable or input
  definitions.
